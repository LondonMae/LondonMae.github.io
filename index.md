I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at UCLA, advised by Dr. Euncie Jun. My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, programming languages, and software systems. I am enthusiastic about developing software abstractions that empower people to solve problems.   

My past research spans human-computing interaction and high-performance computing, including research on work-stealing algorithms and fully-unpriviledged container services. I recieved a B.S degree in Computer Science and German Studies from Rhodes College.
