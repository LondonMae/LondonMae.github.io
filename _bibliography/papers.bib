      abstract = {Carefully constructed experimental designs are essential for drawing valid, generalizable conclusions from scientific experiments. Unfortunately, experimental designs can be difficult to specify, communicate clearly, and relate to alternatives. In response, we introduce
a grammar of composable operators for constructing experimental
assignment procedures (e.g., Latin square). The PLanet DSL implements this grammar. Researchers specify assignment requirements,
which PLanet compiles into constraint-satisfaction problems over
matrices to determine viable experimental plans. In an expressivity
evaluation, we find that PLanet is the most expressive compared
to two existing experimental-design libraries. Its composability
enables expression of both canonical and customized designs in
HCI experiments. Case studies with three researchers reveal how
PLanet helps them make complex design choices explicit, explore
alternatives, and develop a deeper understanding of experimental
design.} ,

abstract = {Anxiety and depression rates in Computer Science (CS) students are double those of other undergraduates and 5-10 times higher than the general population. However, factors contributing to the elevated mental health issues in CS students remain unknown. To bridge this gap, we conducted need-finding interviews (N=20), which revealed that the complexity of debugging, along with imposter syndrome, are key contributors to stress and burnout. Participants expressed openness toward and feature preferences in a computer-based Personal Informatics (PI) tool to facilitate self-reflection. In response, we developed EmotionStream, an algorithm-assisted PI tool that provides both contextual and emotional insights based on individual behaviors. We found that participants rated their experience with the tool highly. Post-hoc analysis revealed that emotional states, augmented with contextual cues, show promise of predicting real-time stress. Based on our findings, we provide design implications for future PI tools to support CS student mental well-being.},

abstract = {Emerging technologies are transforming all areas of life, and the
information workplace is at the forefront of innovation. Passive
sensing technologies, with significant potential to monitor human
behavior and offer insights, are particularly effective for information
workers, as their computer-centric tasks enable seamless integration. These technologies can potentially provide valuable insights
to support workers by tracking well-being and performance. Prior
research has examined various stakeholders’ views, such as managers and employees, on workplace monitoring and its contesting
notions of worker well-being and performance. However, with the
fast-paced advancements in information technology and increasing
anxiety among university students, attitudes regarding workplace
culture and practices can impact the desirability and choice to pursue career options in Computer Science (CS). In this study, we
recruited 20 university CS students to understand their perspectives on these technologies as future workers. Our findings surface
how students perceived such technologies, whether and how their
views differ from current workers, and how their views on organizational culture changed based on its adoption. From our findings, we
propose initial implications for the design and adoption of future
workplace monitoring technologies.},
