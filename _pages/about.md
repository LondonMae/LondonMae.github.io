I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at UCLA, advised by Dr. Eunice
Jun, where I currently design tools for scientists to reason about data. My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer
interaction, programming languages, and causal inference. Broadly, I'm enthusiastic about
developing abstractions that empower people to reason about and make decisions under uncertainty.   

My past research spans human-computing interaction and high-performance
computing, including research on work-stealing algorithms and
fully-unpriviledged container services Los Alamos National Laboratory. I recieved a B.S degree in Computer
Science and German Studies from Rhodes College.
